# Process-Terminator
A lightweight Windows console utility to quickly terminate running Discord processes. Useful for developers, modders, or testers who need to fully stop Discord before DLL injection, updates, debugging, or restarting audio hooks. 

# Why use this?

Discord often keeps background processes alive even after closing the app.
This tool ensures all related processes are fully terminated, preventing:

DLL injection failures

Audio hook issues

Update conflicts

Port / resource locking problems
